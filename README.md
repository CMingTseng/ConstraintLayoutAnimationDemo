# ConstraintLayoutAnimationDemo

This Android project is a simple demo of doing transitions (animations) between two ConstraintSets in a ConstraintLayout.

Note that the application is designed for tablets and only tested on a Nexus 9 for now. For smaller devices you will have to adapt the sizes accordingly.
